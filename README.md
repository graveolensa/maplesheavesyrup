I'm going to place the svg files for illustrated sheaves/presheaves etc. here.


If I'm performing power series manipulations, well, that's not all that tricky.

If we're talking about the sort of mathematics that has these monstrosities:

"... we see that there are three cases: in the first case l<k and we can iterate
over the subgroups of the nearest cyclic group to Zk. If l is not coprime to k,
we're already done (see Theorem 2.2.1)..." 

hi this is not even remotely readable
and taken out of context it's really difficult to figure out what's going on. Is
there a tvtropes page about sheaves and category theory? I'm going to have difficulty
remembering in which categories fiber products commute with colimits unless I have some
immediately emotional way of relating to them, and pages and pages of diagrams is not the
way to lower the barrier to entry for this material.

So Aryhbhata wrote in verse? Why not a Shakespearean presentation?
